[section:auto_slot_void Automatic slot returning void]
[h5 Rule]
The automatic slot will, upon call, check which thread you called from. 
If that thread is the same one its owning bobject instantiation was assigned with, the automatic slot will behave like a [link boost_object.walkthrough.slots.direct_slot direct ( synchronous ) slot].
Otherwise it will behave like a non-blocking [link boost_object.walkthrough.slots.async_slot queued ( asynchronous ) slot].
